dani
    this tool allows to run actions, such as clicking, typing, etc. in a page.

how to use?
    add:

    <script src="https://raw.githack.com/Ruk33/dani/master/dani.js"></script>

    at the bottom of your page. that's it. with this, the tool will show up
    and you are ready to feed in actions. the documentation resides inside
    this tool.

how do these "actions" look like?
    here is a list of actions which, type "text" into an input and clicks
    a button with a label "increase":

    type [text] in [id="some-input"]
    click [id="some-button"] with increase

    this tool enforces and only works with nodes having an id, the reason for
    this is to improve reliability. just add an id to the node you want to use
    or test.

examples?
    check preact.html, which simulates a single page application using preact
    (an alternative, very similar library to react) having this tool already
    running.

why?
    this tool was intended for doing qa/automation, and usually, there is way
    too much config/setup to do upfront to simply do one thing, run some
    actions that users may do in a webpage. this tool can do that without any
    configs. just jump into your page and start running actions or testing it!
